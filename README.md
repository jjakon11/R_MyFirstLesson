## For a Newbie, You Can Start Here:

This course is a one-hour lab session at National Chung-Hsing University. Since it’s a short, one-hour class, the focus is on basic knowledge of R, data compiling, and data visualization. The datasets used are primarily open data, and most of the students have a background in ecology. Therefore, this lab course will demonstrate climate, spatial, and tree data in an accessible and engaging way.

The repository’s name is intended to emphasize that this is my first R class for the semester. It might be your first R lesson ever, but it’s also my first time teaching R at the university level.

This version of the course content is still a work in progress. The .rmd file reflects the real course experience, though occasionally students need more time for practice, and classes may fall slightly behind the original schedule.

## After 14 hour, You will be a Pro Man
